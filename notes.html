<!-- notes
directives in vue are just special fnctionalities that you will be using repaeatedly examplease are below like blade in laravel that are available to vue.
v-text basically just adds text to whatever you are adding it to
v-show adds html tags to the element
v-show returns a boolen is an item has being viewed
v-if is similar to show but it actually pulls that element in question out of the DOM
v-else is basically like if else statement
v-pre shows the whole pre formated text that is the whole text including the tag
v-once mean render only once
v-cloak waits till the pages loads before the renders,it wont show the mostaches when loading so the clock covers it
v-bind binds data to attributes instead of just showing them to the screen
v-for is similar to a foor loop in vuejs 
v-model basically does 2 way binding
any event you use v-on for events
computed properties makes taks computed without manually doing them 
the different between computed properties and methods is that computed properties is cached,if it is not cacehd it will have to run the function again everytime it is cached
axios and gizzle is a javasript http library
 loadash is another javascript library for giving your javascript additional functionlities
